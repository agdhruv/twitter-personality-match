# twitter-personality-match

This script uses the IBM Watson `Personality Insights API` and the `Twitter API` to compare the last 200 tweets of two Twitter users (with public profiles), and prints out the closest personality traits shown by the two users.

This was a fun exercise, which introduced me to the beautiful IBM Watson APIs.

The easiest way to run this script is by using a Python virtual environment `virtualenv`. Use `requirements.txt` to install all required Python packages.
